Assignment 3 Feedback:

Total Grade:   26/ 50

General Comments: Please review A3 solution to understand the correct approach for Problem 2.


Functionality:   8/ 20
   Based on the tests form gitlab.

Problem 1 Solution Quality:   8/ 10
    See rubric below.

Problem 2 Solution Quality:   0/ 10
    See rubric below.

Comments: Test case 08 fails for Problem 1. Your next() needs to check if the iterator is pointing to NULL, and if so, move to the head of the list (if the list is not empty).

Problem 2 not attempted.

  - consistent formatting
  - is easy to read
  - does not have any function definitions in header files 

  (6/10) Code is mostly readable if
  - somewhat follows style guidelines
  - mostly consistent formatting

  - marker is having difficulty understanding your code

  (4/10) Code is hard to read if
  - follows a few of the guidelines
  - somewhat consistent formatting
