PART A:
Briefly dexcribe how you measure the runtime of the strlen() functions.
Be sure to include:
- The size of the input data
- The number of repetitions performed
- A brief description of what your program does

Explanation:


========================================================================
PART B:

Enter 10 measurements for each of the three functions.
strlen_byte():
1:
2:
3:
4:
5:

8:
9:
10:
--------
Average: 

strlen_word():
1:
2:
3:
4:

Average: 

strlen_std():

Average: 


========================================================================
PART C:

Compute the relative speed of each of the functions relative to the 
fastest one.  So, the fastest function should have a relative speed
of 1, and the other two will have relative speeds greater than 1.

strlen_byte(): 

strlen_word():

strlen_std():

========================================================================
PART D:

Provide a hypothesis as to the differences between the relative performance 
of strlen_byte() and strlen_word().

Hypothesis:
