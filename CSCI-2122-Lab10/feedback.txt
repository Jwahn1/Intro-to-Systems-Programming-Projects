======

Part A: (2 marks)
  2/2 
   - Program is implemented and explanation matches implementations
  
  1/2 
   - Solid attempt at program implementation with an explanation.  OR
   - Program is implemented but there is no (or very poor) explanation
     of how it works.

  0/2
   - No attempt made.

Part B: (2 marks)
  2/2 
   - Data is gathered.
   - Data is within norms.
     - strlen_std speed is about 9 (+/- 2) times faster than strlen_byte
     - strlen_std speed is about 5 (+/- 2) times faster than strlen_word
     - strlen_word speed is about 2 (+/- 0.5) times faster than strlen_byte
  
  1/2 
   - Data is gathered.
   - Data is varying widely from above norms.

  0/2
   - No attempt made.

Part C: (2 marks)
  2/2 
   - Averages and ratios are computed 
   - Results are within norms
     - strlen_std speed is about 9 (+/- 2) times faster than strlen_byte
     - strlen_std speed is about 5 (+/- 2) times faster than strlen_word
     - strlen_word speed is about 2 (+/- 0.5) times faster than strlen_byte
  
  1/2 
   - Averages and ratios are computed
   - Results do not appear within norms.

  0/2
   - No attempt made.

Part D: (2 marks)
  2/2 
   - Expanation is reasonable:  strlen_word() accesses 8 bytes at a time
     so it performs fewers memory accesses and hence is faster.
   - No explanation for why strlen_std() is even faster is needed, but
     feel free to give bonus marks if a reasonable explanation provided.

  1/2 
   - Explanation is attempted

  0/2
   - No attempt made.
