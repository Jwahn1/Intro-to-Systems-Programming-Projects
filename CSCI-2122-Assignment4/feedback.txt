     - marks may be deducted for very inefficient solutions
  - All tests are passing.

  (8/10) Good Solution
  - Program is complete
  - Algorithm or data structures are inefficient 
  - Nearly all tests are passing.

  (6/10) Marginal Solution
  - Implementation has some minor bugs. (Some tests are passing)

-------------
  (10/10) Professional looking code should be:
  - well commented
  - follows style guidelines
  - consistent formatting
  - is easy to read
  - does not have any function definitions in header files 
    (prototype declarations are ok)

  (8/10) Code looks good if:
  - follows style guidelines
  - consistent formatting
  - is easy to read
  - does not have any function definitions in header files 

  (6/10) Code is mostly readable if
  - somewhat follows style guidelines
  - mostly consistent formatting
  - does not have any function definitions in header files 
  - marker is having difficulty understanding your code

  (4/10) Code is hard to read if
  - follows a few of the guidelines
  - somewhat consistent formatting
  - has function definitions in header files 
  - marker can barely understand your code

  (2/10) Code is illegible
  - if it cannot be understood
